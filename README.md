# Image-Classifier-Project
Flower Image Classifier Project is from Udacity's data science nanodegree program.

Below is the project info from Udacity:

In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.

The dataset is from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html.
